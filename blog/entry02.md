##### Novembver 27, 2023
## Softwares People Used for Traveling
After choosing my topic, Travel for my Freedom Project, I began to research Softwares and hardwares people use in their daily lives for traveling. First I started researching about softwares people use for traveling. The first search I did was "Traveling softwares" where I came across [this](https://www.travelperk.com/blog/travel-management-software/) website. This website was titled **"Top 20 best travel management software tools in 2023"** which caught my attention. This website is very reliable and the TravelPerk app itself has **the** best travel management systems yet. Besides the TravelPerk app the website also contained many other apps that helps manage people's travel, like the app "App in the Air". This app helps people plan, book, track and manage their travels. Using this app people can receive notifications and updates on terminals, gates, and baggage belts. This app makes sure they make it on time and keeps people on track for a more efficient traveling expierence! While I continue researching I came across [another website](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/ska3xxjs2) titled "The top travel-tech trends set to revolutionize tourism in 2023" This website talks about AR/VR technologies and Artificial intelligence slowly being introduced.




## Engineering Disign Process (EDP)
I am now at the second stage where I _research_ about past and present softwares/hardwares that people use to travel today internationally or locally. In the next stage I will be putting these informations together and finding out what might be some future traveling technologies.

## Skills 
### How to Google
For part A: Sofwares I searched up **_Traveling Softwares_**. Many websites came up but I couldn't take the time to look through every single one of them so I examined their title and little description to find a website that fits the topic. Next up I searched for **_Traveling hardware technologies_** and again multiple websites came up but I only look for the ones that fit the topic the most. 
### FInding If a Website is Reliable
When we google we want to find the information we are looking for quickly and easily but sometimes a source that we are looking at **may not be reliable**. When I come across a website with what I'm looking for **I search up the name of the website to see if it's a reliable source.** I also **search up the person who provided the information to this website to see their _credentials_**. This is a crucial skill when it comes to researching because we don't want to put false information.
