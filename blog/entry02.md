##### Novembver 27, 2023
## Part A: Softwares People Used for Traveling
After choosing my topic, Travel for my Freedom Project, I began to research Softwares and hardwares people use in their daily lives for traveling. First I started researching about softwares people use for traveling. The first search I did was "Traveling softwares" where I came across [this](https://www.travelperk.com/blog/travel-management-software/) website. This website was titled **"Top 20 best travel management software tools in 2023"** which caught my attention. This website is very reliable and the TravelPerk app itself has **the** best travel management systems yet. Besides the TravelPerk app the website also contained many other apps that helps manage people's travel, like the app "App in the Air". This app helps people plan, book, track and manage their travels. Using this app people can receive notifications and updates on terminals, gates, and baggage belts. This app makes sure they make it on time and keeps people on track for a more efficient traveling expierence! While I continue researching I came across [another website](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/ska3xxjs2) titled "The top travel-tech trends set to revolutionize tourism in 2023" This website talks about AR/VR technologies and Artificial intelligence slowly being introduced. Artifical intelligence is being added to tourism industries in parts of the world where it shows big success. These website shows what people use to manage their travels everyday.
## Part B: Hardwares People Use for Traveling
After researching about softwares that people use for traveling I began researching for hardwares that people use for traveling. My first search was **"Traveling hardware Technologies"** As I looked around I found [this website](https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/cool-gadgets/essential-travel-tech-gear) titled "The 22 Best Travel Tech Essentials of 2023." One thing that caught my eye was the  **Best Wi-fi HotspotGlocalMe G4 Pro 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot.** How would all of these smartphones and devices work without wifi? The G4 pro $G LTE Mobile Hotspot can connect up to **TEN** smartphones which can come in handy traveling in a big group or with family. Most importantly this hotspot does not need a **SIM card.** This can cover **140+ countries and regions** which means we can use this hotspot anywhere and everywhere. What is also crucial is [portable chargers](https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-portable-chargers-power-banks/) because if a device dies is becomes useless and we won't be able to use any apps or softwares. The **Anker 737 power bank**can charge **3 devices at once** with no problem. Most impotantly Devices can be charged from 0-100% in an hour. I also found [Noise canceling headphones](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcS3MEEa8aa9Sy7q_5lfRX-09tbFyQpgEfLiVrP7VM_QZzcNCzjRiujkd-561pDopRLHd3lonzlOdXAckUKH6WAmIbrjdGw-4E0BHARuWzKap9WuWA4UdWFl4g) that are a must have on international traveling. Noise canceling headphones can help cancel out unwanted noise on airplanes and other transportations. It also varies in sizes depending on what you like best. These hardware products are a must have when it comes 









## Engineering Disign Process (EDP)
I am now at the second stage where I _research_ about past and present softwares/hardwares that people use to travel today internationally or locally. In the next stage I will be putting these informations together and finding out what might be some future traveling technologies.

## Skills 
### How to Google
For part A: Sofwares I searched up **_Traveling Softwares_**. Many websites came up but I couldn't take the time to look through every single one of them so I examined their title and little description to find a website that fits the topic. Next up I searched for **_Traveling hardware technologies_** and again multiple websites came up but I only look for the ones that fit the topic the most. 
### FInding If a Website is Reliable
When we google we want to find the information we are looking for quickly and easily but sometimes a source that we are looking at **may not be reliable**. When I come across a website with what I'm looking for **I search up the name of the website to see if it's a reliable source.** I also **search up the person who provided the information to this website to see their _credentials_**. This is a crucial skill when it comes to researching because we don't want to put false information.
## Next Steps
I am very excited for the next research we are gonna do on future traveling Softwares/hardwares.
