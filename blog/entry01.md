# Choosing a topic
The topic that I decided to choose for this project is travel because I like going to different places and exploring/learning new things. I didn't choose this topic because I wanted to work with my friends but because I want more people to travel and have fun like me. At first I was thinking of choosing a subject related to gaming and making games but then I realized that I am actually really passionate about Travel and adventure. While researching for this topic I found some interesting sites like [The Latest Travel Data](https://www.ustravel.org/research/monthly-travel-data-report) by the U.S. Travel Association, ['Revenge travel' is surging](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105323610/flight-tickets-inflation-pandemic-revenge-travel-vacation-europe-recession) by Manuela LÃ³pez Restrepo, a producer and writer in NPR. But the website I am most interested in would be [How Technology Affects The Way We Travel?](https://www.opengrowth.com/resources/how-technology-affects-the-way-we-travel) by Roshni Khatri, Credentials: A keen observer, who loves to spend time with nature. A fun loving person, enjoys to explore the new aspects of life. Passionate about reading and learning new things. Roshni is dedicated towards her work and has worked in different professions. This specific article made me more interested in traveling technologies that can help people better travel and make it fun even if traveling alone. These technologies make traveling way more fun and I want to create something that's even better that people can use to navigate etc. The more I research about technology connected with traveling the more passionate I am about this topic.
