# Choosing a topic
The topic that I decided to choose for this project is travel because I like going to different places and exploring/learning new things. I didn't choose this topic because I wanted to work with my friends but because I want more people to expierence the fun of traveling around the world.  At first I was thinking of choosing a subject related to gaming and making games but then I realized that I am actually really passionate about Travel and adventure. While researching for this topic I found some interesting sites like [The Latest Travel Data](https://www.ustravel.org/research/monthly-travel-data-report) by the U.S. Travel Association, ['Revenge travel' is surging](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105323610/flight-tickets-inflation-pandemic-revenge-travel-vacation-europe-recession) by Manuela LÃ³pez Restrepo, a producer and writer in NPR. But the website I am most interested in would be [How Technology Affects The Way We Travel?](https://www.opengrowth.com/resources/how-technology-affects-the-way-we-travel) by Roshni Khatri, Credentials: A keen observer, who loves to spend time with nature. "A fun loving person, enjoys to explore the new aspects of life. Passionate about reading and learning new things." This specific article made me more interested in traveling technologies that can help people better travel and make it fun even if traveling alone. These technologies make traveling way more fun and I want to create something that's even better that people can use to navigate etc. The more I research about technology connected with traveling the more passionate I am about this topic.
# Engineering Design Process
I am in the first stage of the engineering design process right now, where the main goal is to **define** the problem. The problem that i want to solve with my project is to make _**traveling more fun for people again because since the pandemic people haven't been able to travel and now people are slowly going back to traveling and normal lives.**_ In stage 2 I will be researching about the problem that I am trying to solve and I plan to use my articles and websites that I mentioned before and other sources that I may come acorss while researching. I will also be looking at surveys about people throughts on traveling technologies.
# Skills
Some skills that I have learned from working on my blog entry is time management, how to google, and maintaining focus.
