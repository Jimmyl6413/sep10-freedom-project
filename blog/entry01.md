# Entry 1: Deciding on my Topic(Travel)
##### 10/23/23
# Choosing a topic
The topic that I decided to choose for this project is travel because I like going to different places and exploring/learning new things. I didn't choose this topic because I wanted to work with my friends but because I want more people to expierence the fun of traveling around the world. At first I was thinking of choosing a subject related to gaming and making games but then I realized that I am actually really passionate about Travel and adventure. While researching for this topic I found some interesting sites like [The Latest Travel Data](https://www.ustravel.org/research/monthly-travel-data-report) by the U.S. Travel Association, ['Revenge travel' is surging](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105323610/flight-tickets-inflation-pandemic-revenge-travel-vacation-europe-recession) by Manuela LÃ³pez Restrepo, a producer and writer in NPR. But the website I am most interested in would be [How Technology Affects The Way We Travel?](https://www.opengrowth.com/resources/how-technology-affects-the-way-we-travel) by Roshni Khatri, Credentials: A keen observer, who loves to spend time with nature. "A fun loving person, enjoys to explore the new aspects of life. Passionate about reading and learning new things." This specific article made me more interested in traveling technologies that can help people better travel and make it fun even if traveling alone. These technologies make traveling way more fun and I want to create something that's even better that people can use to navigate etc. The more I research about technology connected with traveling the more passionate I am about this topic.
# Engineering Design Process
I am in the first stage of the Engineering Design Process right now, where the main goal is to **define** the problem. The problem that I want to solve with my project is to make _**traveling more fun for people again because since the pandemic people haven't been able to travel and now people are slowly going back to traveling and normal lives.**_ In stage 2 I will be researching about the problem that I am trying to solve and I plan to use my articles and websites that I mentioned before and other sources that I may come acorss while researching. I will also be looking at surveys about people throughts on traveling technologies.
# Skills
Some skills that I have learned from working on my blog entry is time management, how to Google, and maintaining focus.
### Time management
I have several things to do after school, such as doing landry/other chores, homework from other classes, and I get home by train which takes 1 hour. I have decided to do the landry and chores on weekends when I don't have school and use the 1 hour that I take to get home on the train to do my homework from other classes. This will make more time for me to work on this project. This will keep me on task and finish my work on time.
### How to Google
So I wanted to know how does technology impacted the way people traveled and the rates of people traveling before and after the pandemic. I firsted searched for traveling technologies and it showed me many websites but I didn't read through every single website. I looked at their titles and small sentences under the title to see if it was what I was looking for. By doing this I save plenty of time. when I google I always skim through the sources so I can save as much time as possible and that helps me find what I need.
### Maintaining Focus
Maintaining focus is very important when it comes to finishing work on time. To help me maintian focus I like to be in a quite room with my phone or any distractions hidden away from my sight. Being able to maintain focus and finishing on task will do you a big favor after. it might feel tempting to just take a break and relax but trust me after You finish your work it feels 10x better relaxing.
# Next steps
I am looking forward to researching and making my project on my topic travel.
