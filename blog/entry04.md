# Entry 4: Choosing a Tool for the Freedom Project
##### February 12, 2024
### Update
After completing the research on softwares and hardwares on traveling, I began looking for tools I can use to help me with my Freedom Project. I am now on step 4 of the project, planning. I will be planning and choosing some tools for this project.

### Content
In this blog entry I will be going over what tools I chose and how I tinkered with the tools I choosed. I will be able to explain how to use the tool and what it will be useful for in this project.

##  [Animated.css](https://animate.style/)
**Animated.css** has a variety of animations and features that we can use on different elements and codes.


## [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
I am working on step 4 of the Engineering Design Process where I will be learning how to use tools to help me with my Freedom Project. I will be using these tools to **create a prototype** for my Freedom project in step five.
## Skills

### Self-learning
Since we all chose different tools we had to learn how to use these tools before we begin making a prototype of our project. My tools were A-frame and Animated.css. I learned how to use my tools through various testing and watching videos. After testing different codes over and over again and using guides on A-frame I was able to create a 3D model of shapes and backgrounds. I also learned to animate different elements to appear differently using Animated.css.

### How to Google
When I first started testing out my tools I didn't know what some of the codes did or how to use them. For example, I didn't know what ```@keyframe``` was used for so I searched up "Keyframe css". This brought me to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-keyframes.php) where I learned that keyframes are used to specify the animation code. By searching up various codes that I never saw or learned before I was able to undertsand how to use them. I was also able to test them out in w3schools. Learning how to google the right information you are looking for can save you a lot of time.



### Next steps
I will be using the tools that I learned to create a prototype of my freedom project. This is gonna be a blast!
