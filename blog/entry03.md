 # Entry 3: Possible Software or Hardwares in the Future
##### December 18, 2023
### Update
After completing the research on part A, Past and current softwares/hardwares. I began to organize the information I got through research and pieced them together. Now I am on step 3 of the FP: **Brainstorming**. 
### Brainstorming Possible Furture Inventions
In the process of brainstorming we had to come up with possible future inventions or improvemnts of the past and current softwares/hardwares. I started brainstorming my ideas that we can create in the future to make traveling more enjoyable and safe for people. I came up with a better app with a combination of all the other apps people need for traveling. The app:
- No delays in time (to ensure the time is always accurate, the transportation method is constantly being tracked by radar or tracked by other travelers who are using the app)
- Provides active management 
- Includes free rides if Uber arrives late
- Includes free movie and games on rides (Catch: the entertainment ends when the trip is over)
- Shows safety of a location (aqi, temperature, etc)
- Provides alerts (weather, delays, nearby crimes)
- Functions in any place (countries, states)
- Includes a hub section (people who are traveling, in particular, can engage with other travelers)
- Provides details even when the app is offline (scheduled time of travel methods, guided map, tourist attractions, set plans)
- Embedded safety features (ex: keeping track of steps through the vibration of human movement)
- Includes security details (making accounts, settings, etc)
