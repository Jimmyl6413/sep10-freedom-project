 # Entry 3: Possible Software or Hardwares in the Future
##### December 18, 2023
### Update
After completing the research on part A, Past and current softwares/hardwares. I began to organize the information I got through research and pieced them together. Now I am on step 3 of the FP: **Brainstorming**. 
### Brainstorming Possible Furture Inventions
First me and my partner, Joe looked over our organized notes, which included the products [Rolling Square inCharge 6 Portable Charger cable](https://www.amazon.com/inCharge-Six-One-Portable-Compatible/dp/B086WHBN3N/?tag=pcworld02-20&asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000726/travel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html), [WYND Air Purifier](https://hellowynd.com/products/essential?variant=44129312440593), [SIMO Soils Life Portable Mobile Hotespot](https://www.amazon.com/Hotspot-Coverage-Connected-Devices-Technology/dp/B08YKB6VMN/?tag=pcworld02-20&asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000726/travel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html), [CrazyCap Self Cleaning Water Bottle](https://www.amazon.com/CrazyCap-Pro-Award-Winning-Self-Cleaning-Insulated/dp/B0B4BPJGLV/?tag=pcworld02-20&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Farticle%2F2000726%2Ftravel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html&th=1&psc=1), and apps like [Navan](https://navan.com/), and [TravelPerk](https://www.travelperk.com/blog/travel-management-software/). Upon review, we tired to think of softwares/hardwares that we can make that has all these features and better!

In the process of brainstorming we had to come up with possible future inventions or improvemnts of the past and current softwares/hardwares. I started brainstorming my ideas that we can create in the future to make traveling more enjoyable and safe for people. Me and my partner Joe came up with a better app with a combination of all the other apps people need for traveling. The app has:
- No delays in time (to ensure the time is always accurate, the transportation method is constantly being tracked by radar or tracked by other travelers who are using the app)
- Provides active management 
- Includes free rides if Uber arrives late
- Includes free movie and games on rides (Catch: the entertainment ends when the trip is over)
- Shows safety of a location (aqi, temperature, etc)
- Provides alerts (weather, delays, nearby crimes)
- Functions in any place (countries, states)
- Includes a hub section (people who are traveling, in particular, can engage with other travelers)
- Provides details even when the app is offline (scheduled time of travel methods, guided map, tourist attractions, set plans)
- Embedded safety features (ex: keeping track of steps through the vibration of human movement)
- Includes security details (making accounts, settings, etc)

We came up with this by looking at Part A to see what we can imporve or what's missing that can be invented in the future. We realized that instead of using 5 different apps while traveling we can combine the apps into one. Also having a nice vehicle while traveling or on road trips are very important. That's why we came up with a new car that can possibly become the best traveling vehicle in the future. This car won't just be fast and floating off the ground. _The car will be able to go underwater and in the air_. To achieve this we need a powerful engin and motor. This vehicle will be powered by electricity and fully waterproof so nothing gets wet or damaged. The materials used to create this vehicle will also be very strong and durable. This vehicle will become the best traveling vehicle! We are only focusing on these 2 for now because we wanna make these inventions more realistic and possible for the furture. To **finalize** our content me and my partner made sure we had enough information, ideas, and details for these new inventions. We also got feedback from our classmates so we can improve on what we had.
## Engineering Disign Process (EDP)
I am now on step 3 of the Engineering Disign Process where I brainstorm about possible future inventions for my topic **_Travel_**. I will be using my creativity to brainstorm and think of possible inventions that will be added to **Traveling Industries** in the future.
## Skills
### Creativity
While brainstorming possible inventions in the future for traveling I used my creativity to create possible in inventions. Using my creativity allow me to think of more unique invention ideas such as vehicles that can fly and go underwater in the future. Doesn't that sound like a cool vehicle to use while on a road trip or traveling with family and friends?
### Teamwork 
Since I am working on the Freedom Project with a partner, teamwork is very important. Without good teamwork we won't be able to work efficently. To achieve good teamwork we need to ustilize class time. Outside of shcool we can still work together by calling or meeting up.
## Next steps
I will be finalizing everything I have got and start planning. I am very excited!
