### Update
We've reached the end of our year long project! We finished coding our website and we presented what we all made. Everyone's Freedom Project was a success and we've more to come next in the next 2 years! Now we are beginning to wrap things up and we will add our freedom projects to our portfolio soon!

### Context


## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

## Skills

### Creativity
Creativity was an important skill that was needed for the Freedom Project as everyone had different ideas of what they want to make and different topics. We needed to be creative with the design of our websites, layouts, color schemes, components, and tools.

### Self-learning
Self-learning is very important as everyone used different tools. I had to learn how to use animated.css and a-frame for my Freedom Project. We also had to teach ourselves how to solve problems with our code because there wasn't always somebody to help. Youtube and the internet was a great source of help for me because there was always something I could fine that helped solve the issue I had. Sometimes I also got different ideas from the internet as one time I was scrolling through youtube and there was a video that came up on how we can change our website icons. I used that video to change my website icons.
## Next steps
We will add our Freedom Project to our portfolio so that it's there to represent what we've learned, done, and achieved over the course of 1 year!
