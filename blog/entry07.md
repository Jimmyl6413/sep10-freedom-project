### Update
We've reached the end of our year long project! We finished coding our website and we presented what we all made. Everyone's Freedom Project was a success and we've more to come next in the next 2 years! Now we are beginning to wrap things up and we will add our freedom projects to our portfolio soon!

## Content

### In-Class Presentation

Me and my partner Joe made a [google slide presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y_WxQUBVwVSWlmgBhd8s24UOm_IPpfGh-H2BJjkCRk4/edit#slide=id.p) for our in class presentation which goes through different challenges, success, and purpose of our project. This presentation prepared us for the expo elevator pitch that was coming up. I had many takeways from this presentation. I learned that I needed to make more eye contact and explain more in depth of my code and purpose of my project. I also learned that me and Joe were very bad at communicating when presenting so we knew we had to practice a lot for the expo elevator pitch. This was what we've been wait for all year and working towards all year, the Freedom project.

### Expo Elevator Pitch
During our Expo elevator pitch we had one minute to present what we made and the purpose of what we made in which I had many takeaways. Me and Joe planned out how we were gonna present our elevator pitch in our [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14SmxUgDBHcs8CC8RRI8-yK_nnkAcw1OodxcWRIkEORk/edit). I learned that presenting what I made and what the purpose of my website is, was more clear and that I actually my self got a better understanding of my own website through explaining how I made it and what the purpose was. I also learned that it wasn't that bad to present an elevator pitch of my project, it was easier than I had expected.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
We've now reached step 8, the final step of the Freedom Project where we start wrapping up our year long project. We will add our freedom project to our portfolio next!

## Skills

### Creativity
Creativity was an important skill that was needed for the Freedom Project as everyone had different ideas of what they want to make and different topics. We needed to be creative with the design of our websites, layouts, color schemes, components, and tools.

### Self-learning
Self-learning is very important as everyone used different tools. I had to learn how to use animated.css and a-frame for my Freedom Project. We also had to teach ourselves how to solve problems with our code because there wasn't always somebody to help. Youtube and the internet was a great source of help for me because there was always something I could fine that helped solve the issue I had. Sometimes I also got different ideas from the internet as one time I was scrolling through youtube and there was a video that came up on how we can change our website icons. I used that video to change my website icons.

## Next steps
We will add our Freedom Project to our [portfolio](https://jimmyl6413.github.io/) so that it's there to represent what we've learned, done, and achieved over the course of 1 year!
