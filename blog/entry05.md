# Entry 5
##### April 8, 2024

### Update
After choosing my tools that I will be using for my Freedom Project, I began tinkering with my tools over the course of 5 weeks.
### Context
 In this blog I will be going through a series of things that I did to tinker with [Animated.css](https://animate.style/) and [a-frame](https://aframe.io/).

 ## Process of learning Animated.css
 I started by importing animated.css through CDN ```<link rel="stylesheet"  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css"
/>``` to my LOYO practice on bootstrap components. I decided to practice animated.css in my LOYO practice so that I can tinker and learn on my own about bootstrap components. It's a win, win. I was able to learn more about delays, durations, repeats, and more animated.css etc. I used delays to delay the time that the text will fade in, in each section.
```html

  <h1 class="animate__animated animate__tada animate__delay-2s" id="test2"> Hello!</h1>
  <h2 class="animate__animated animate__rubberBand animate__delay-3s" id="test2"> Welcome to my practice html file for animated.css!</h2>
  <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__slower">

```
I implemented animations to my text, paragraphs, titles, navbar, and [more!](https://github.com/hstatsep-students/bootstrap-components-practice-Jimmyl6413/blob/main/index.html).

### Takeaways
I was able to learn different components of bootstrap and then using the left over time to style what I made even more by using animated.css. I was able to make my website more interesting and catch the users attentions.
