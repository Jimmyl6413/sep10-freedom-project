# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Jimmy Li**

## Context
For my project, I chose the topic of **Traveling/Transportation**.

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **Animated.css** in order to help me make by website.

I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing. For this Freedom Project I worked alongside Joe, my peer. We chose the topic travel as we both had a really big passion for travel. Traveling has been hard ever since the pendemic in 2020. So we figured that this was a topic that we wanted to research about and make a website about. We used a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Animated.css to construct a website regarding travel. Me and Joe both used different tools. Joe used A-frame while I used Animated.css. In this way, Joe was able to make 3d models of future designs/inventions that we had in mind and I was able to make our website more engaging with animations and transitions.
