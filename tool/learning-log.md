* I watched this [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktjMCanKNLk&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV) about A-Frame to learn more about scaling and backgrounds.
* By watching the video, I was able to learn how to use positioning, scaling, wdith, height, and depth. I was also able to learn how to use and make different shapes like boxes, cylinders, circles, and squares. I can change the appearenece of these shapes to my liking my using depth, width, scaling, positioning, and height etc.
* I learned how to make a forest background using this [building a basic scene guide](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/guides/building-a-basic-scene.html).
* This guide page had a variety of starter codes and information that would me useful for me. It teaches similar things in the video. But I was able to learn new things like sound and animations. A-Frame is a good platform to create realistic expierences that come up in our minds.
