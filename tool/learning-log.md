# Tool Learning Log

Tool: **A-Frame & Animated.css**

---

## February 26-29, 2024
* I watched this [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktjMCanKNLk&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV) about A-Frame to learn more about scaling and backgrounds.
* By watching the video, I was able to learn how to use positioning, scaling, wdith, height, and depth. I was also able to learn how to use and make different shapes like boxes, cylinders, circles, and squares. I can change the appearenece of these shapes to my liking my using depth, width, scaling, positioning, and height etc.
* I learned how to make a forest background using this [building a basic scene guide](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/guides/building-a-basic-scene.html).
* This guide page had a variety of starter codes and information that would me useful for me. It teaches similar things in the video. But I was able to learn new things like sound and animations. A-Frame is a good platform to create realistic expierences that come up in our minds.
* I then moved on to the [Components](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/core/component.html) of A-frame which I can LOYO on to see what is suited for this project.

* I imported animated.css through CDN to my LOYO practice on bootstrap components.
* As I was doing my LOYO on bootstrap components I realized I can practice [Animated.css](https://animate.style/)to help to animate my bootstrap components.
* By doing so I was able to tinker with my tool and LOYO at the same time. I was able to learn more about delays, durations, repeats, and more animated.css etc.
* I used delays to delay the time that the text will fade in, in each section.
* I implemented animations to my text, paragraphs, titles, navbar, and [more!](https://github.com/hstatsep-students/bootstrap-components-practice-Jimmyl6413/blob/main/index.html).
* Take away: I was able to learn different components of bootstrap and then using the left over time to style what I made even more by using animated.css. I was able to make my website more interesting and catch the users attentions.

## March 11-18, 2024
* I was able get a better understanding of animated.css by [watching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzbBcVRquYA) a video. I usually undertstand something better when it's explained to me so this was very helpful.
* Practiced more Animated.css in my SHABR project.
* Practiced A-frame with my FP partner Joe who helped me understand the different scaling and positioning in A-frame.
