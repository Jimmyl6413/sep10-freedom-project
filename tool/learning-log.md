* I watched this [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktjMCanKNLk&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV) about A-Frame to learn more about scaling and backgrounds.
* I learned how to make a forest background using this [building a basic scene guide](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/guides/building-a-basic-scene.html).
