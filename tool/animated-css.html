   <p class="my-element">	Indigenous responses to colonial rule during the period 1750 to 1900 were significantly effective, as evidenced by the Ashante Rebellion of 1900 against the British empire because their Golden Stool was  protected. In addition, the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against the East India Company and Great Britain was effective because they gained respect for their religion and independence in 1947. The Ashante and Sepoys challenged colonial authority and altered power dynamics by unifying their power and starting a rebellion to gain respect and independence. The historical developments that led to the establishment of colonies included new forms of transportation such as railway lines and steamships that gave Europeans access to the interior of Africa and other empires. This allowed for the swift movement of both goods and people (armies).  The advancement of new technologies also allowed the British to rapidly expand across Europe using advanced weapons like machine guns and cannons etc. During this time period Nationalism drove competition between European powers to conquer more and more of the world. Empires competed with each other for raw material and resources.
